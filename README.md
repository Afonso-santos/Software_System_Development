# Software_System_Development

## Grade: 16/20 ⭐️
This project was developed as part of the Software System Development (Pt – Desenvolvimento de Sistemas de Software) course in the Software Engineering degree at the University of Minho during the 2024/2025 academic year.

The main goal of this academic project is to apply formal modelling techniques in the early stages of software system development. By focusing on the design and specification phase, we aim to improve clarity, reduce ambiguities, and ensure a rigorous understanding of the system's behaviour before implementation.

Throughout the project, we produced several types of diagrams to support system modelling and documentation, including:

✅ Use Case Diagrams – to capture functional requirements and user interactions
🔁 Sequence Diagrams – to describe message exchanges over time between components
🔄 State Machines – to model the dynamic behaviour of system components
📄 Textual Descriptions – to complement diagrams with precise specifications

These artefacts help ensure that both functional and non-functional aspects of the system are thoroughly analyzed and verified. The project also promotes a mindset of correctness by design, encouraging students to think critically about system behaviour and interactions at a formal level.
